# Web Images

These repository is designed to make and easy way to maintain images for the EIS Campus Solutions login page image slide show. A GitHub action is used to publish the `docs` folder as a static site to to be used by the login pages.

## GitHub Pages is a performant option for hosting static websites. Here’s why:

- Static Content Delivery:
    - GitHub Pages serves pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which are inherently fast to load compared to dynamic sites that require server-side processing.
- Global CDN:
    - GitHub Pages uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute content globally, reducing latency by serving files from the nearest edge location.
- No Server Overhead:
    - Since there’s no backend processing, there's no server-side bottleneck. This makes it ideal for blogs, portfolios, documentation, and landing pages.
- HTTPS is enabled by default, which improves both security and performance (via HTTP/2).
